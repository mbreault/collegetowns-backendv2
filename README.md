## Introduction

One sentence: this app is a WalkScore on steroids.

The purpose is to access the livibity of cities and towns in the United States based on series of custom criteria.

### Where WalkScore falls short

Walkscore is amazing.  It is accesses the walkability of a given address with stunning accuracy in most case.   I have used it extensively over the past three years to find apartments across the country.  However, it falls short in a few key areas.

1.  The algoritm is proprietary.  This is understandable, but it makes it difficult to understand why a given address has a given score.

2.  Limited radius.  The limited information that WalkScore does provide indicates that it weights places around a location within a 1.5 mile radius. Anything with 0.25 miles is given the highest score and there is a diminishing weight out to 1.5 miles.  Anything outside of 1.5 miles ignored.

3.  No custom criteria.  WalkScore is a great tool for finding a place to live, but it is not a great tool for finding the best place to live.  It does not take into account the things that are important to me.  For example, I like to live near a grocery store, but I don't care about bars.  WalkScore does not allow me to customize the criteria.

4.  No comparison.  WalkScore is great for finding a place to live, but it is not great for comparing places to live.  I can't compare the walkability of two addresses.

5. Rideshare.  Just because something isn't within 1.5 miles doesn't mean it isn't accessible.  WalkScore does not take into account rideshare services like Uber and Lyft.

6. Infrequent visits.  WalkScore matters for things you visit often:  A grocery store, a coffee shop, a yoga studio, etc.  But what about places you might only go once in a while?  An NFL football game?  The opera?  A fancy dinner?  WalkScore does not take into account these infrequent visits.

### How this app addresses these shortcomings

1. Custom criteria.  This app allows the user to customize the criteria.  The user can select from a list of criteria and assign a weight to each criteria.  The criteria are then used to calculate a score for each address.

2. Custom radius.  This app allows the user to select a radius.  The radius is used to calculate the score for each address.  For example:

Trader Joes: 2 miles.
The Capital Grille: 60 miles.
MLB Ballpark: 120 miles.
OrangeTheory Fitness: 5 miles.
Starbucks: 1 mile.
D1 College: 2 miles.
